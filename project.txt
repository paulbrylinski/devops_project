1. The main feature of my project will allow 
me to keep track of subscribers for a business.
This will include a database with what subscription they
are subscribed to, and their name, phone number, and email

2. I will need to crEate the following
GET: This will pull up any subscribers for each subscription available 
(I think I will have to create different GET requests in order to have different
URL endpoints for different subsciptions such as subsciptions/wine or subsciptions/beer 
or subsciptions/taco)
POST: This will create a new subscriber and add their information
PUT/PATCH: This will edit a subscriber adding a new subscription if they sign
up for another subscription in addition to their current subscription, 
or change their email or phone

This will all need JSON requests in order to function.

I will not do a Delete request so we always have information and we could
try and get them to resubscribe by sending them emails in the future.


3. This database would be called subscriptions

table 1: subscribers - This would include all subscibers information
table 2: subscriptions - This table shows a list of subscriptions
